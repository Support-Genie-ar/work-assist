Understanding these key terms will help you navigate and use AR Genie Work Assist effectively:

## Jobs:

To perform a work defined in a workflow a job needs to be created. A job contains a list of one or more workflows to be performed, along with the asset on which the work needs to be done. These jobs are the tasks to be performed which need to be assigned to an agent. Assignment can be done for an agent for the whole job or for different agents can be assigned for each individual job workflow.&#x20;

## Job Board:&#x20;

The Job Board is a central dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of all jobs within the AR Genie Work Assist system. It includes current and completed job status, all the assigned jobs, and  backlogs ( pending jobs).&#x20;

The Job Board is designed to give managers, supervisors, and team members a clear and actionable overview of all workflow-related activities. Users can view available Jobs, their priority levels, associated Assets, and other relevant details and monitor or manage workflow-related tasks across their organization.

## Anchors & Anchor Point:

Anchors, also known as AR Anchors, are virtual reference points that AR systems use to place and maintain the position of digital content in the physical world. Anchor Points are specific locations within an Anchor that are used to position AR content precisely.

## Resources ( Gallery ):&#x20;

The Resources, also known as the Gallery, stores various types of media and documents such as images, videos, 3D Objects, Anchor Points, and PDF files / documents used to create comprehensive work instructions. &#x20;

Once uploaded, these resources can be reused across multiple work instructions, ensuring consistency and saving time in content creation. By utilizing the Resources (Gallery), users can create rich, informative work instructions making complex tasks easier to understand and execute in an AR environment.

## Knowledge Base:&#x20;

The Knowledge Base consists of information within AR Genie Work Assist that serves as a centralized resource for users. It's designed to provide quick access to a wide range of helpful information and resources.&#x20;

Here users can save or store the important links from the web or internet, upload files. By utilizing and contributing to the Knowledge Base, users can quickly find answers to their questions, access important resources, and share knowledge across the organization. \
